Hi

"I want to buy a [car make], the [car model] model."
That is exactly what the script send to Google API, and then prints the first webpage using user's browser. The car make and models are customized based on author's favorite car companies and models. The list of options is limited.

This is my first API project, and I have to say it was a fun experience. Enjoy
